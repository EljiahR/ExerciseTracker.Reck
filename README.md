<p>Project for practicing repository pattern</p>
<h3>Assigned requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is an application where you should record exercise data.</li>

  <li>You can choose raw SQL or Entity Framework for your data-persistence.</li>
  <li>The model for your exercise class should have at least the following properties: {Id INT, DateStart DateTime, DateEnd DateTime, Duration TimeSpan, Comments string}</li>
  <li>Your application should have the following classes: ExerciseController, ExerciseService (where business logic will be handled) and ExerciseRepository.</li>
  <li>You need to use dependency injection to access the repository from the controller.</li>
</ul>
